Discription:

1- This is an app to create a readme.md

2- I used 2 js sheets (index.js and generateMarkdown.js)

3- I installed the node inquirer package

4- I created a .gitignore sheet for the node-modules

5- I created a folder (readme-demo), so once I test my app it will create a readme.md inside the readme-demo folder.

I used Screencastify extension on google chrome to record myself while testing the app. Link is in line 5.

Also the link for the repository for this project is in line 2.
